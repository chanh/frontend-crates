"""Render the unified golden corpus for ALL families from ONE scenario spec.

The GOLDEN event list is the authored, spec-derived oracle (best-effort error
recovery, see UNIFIED_CASES.md). It is grammar-INDEPENDENT: a scenario means the
same thing for every family, so its golden events are written once here. Only the
raw model `input` is grammar-specific, rendered from each family's markers. This
is the single source of truth so a scenario can't drift between families
(CLAUDE.md: reuse the shared parent, don't copy-paste divergent cases).

Full matrix: every scenario is emitted for every family (gemma4, qwen3, kimi_k2)
-> conformance/unified/golden_spec/{gemma4,qwen3,kimi}.yaml, the gitignored build
tree. This authored spec is the harness INPUT (unified_render.rs reads it to
compute the live Dynamo column; unified_schema_roundtrip.rs validates it); it is
NOT committed. The committed, versioned golden.tar.gz shard is DERIVED from it via
render -> explode -> package, exactly like every other conformance fixture shard.
