# Writing your own unified parser

You do not need to fork this crate to change how a model's output is parsed. You can implement the `UnifiedParser` trait in your own crate, register it by family name, and it will be used for every request routed to that name — including for a family this crate already ships, which your registration shadows.

Everything below uses only the public API. There is nothing private you need.

## 1. Implement the trait

One method is required. `finish` is required too, because a parser that forgets to flush would silently drop the tail of every stream.

```rust
use dynamo_parsers_v2::{
    Tool, UnifiedParser, UnifiedParserEvent, UnifiedParserOutput,
};
use anyhow::Result;

#[derive(Default)]
struct AcmeParser {
    buffered: String,
}

impl UnifiedParser for AcmeParser {
    /// Called once per decoded delta. Append what THIS delta committed.
    fn parse_into(&mut self, delta: &str, output: &mut UnifiedParserOutput) -> Result<()> {
        self.buffered.push_str(delta);
        // ... decide what is reasoning, what is visible text, what is a tool call ...
        output.push_text(delta);
        Ok(())
    }

    /// Called once at end of stream. Flush anything still buffered.
    fn finish(&mut self) -> Result<UnifiedParserOutput> {
        let mut out = UnifiedParserOutput::default();
        // Whatever is still held back is ordinary text once the stream has ended.
        out.push_text(std::mem::take(&mut self.buffered));
        Ok(out)
    }
}
```

This example is compiled and run as an integration test — [`tests/vendor_parser_example.rs`](tests/vendor_parser_example.rs). It uses only this crate's public API, exactly as your crate would, so if these instructions ever stop being true the build fails here first. Copy from that file if you want something that definitely compiles.

`UnifiedParserOutput` gives you `push_text`, `push_reasoning` and `push_call`. The first two coalesce: appending text onto a trailing text event extends it rather than adding a second one.

## 2. Register it

```rust
fn acme_factory(_tools: &[Tool]) -> Result<Box<dyn UnifiedParser>> {
    Ok(Box::new(AcmeParser::default()))
}

fn main() {
    dynamo_parsers_v2::register_unified_parser("acme_v1", acme_factory);
    // ... start serving. Requests for family "acme_v1" now use your parser.
}
```

Register during startup, before serving. Registration is process-wide and takes effect for parsers created after it returns; a parser already mid-stream keeps the implementation it was built with, so a request cannot straddle the change.

## 3. Replacing a family this crate already ships

Register under the existing name. Your factory is consulted first, so it wins:

```rust
// You disagree with how this crate parses qwen3. Use yours instead.
dynamo_parsers_v2::register_unified_parser("qwen3", my_qwen3_factory);
```

`unregister_unified_parser("qwen3")` removes yours and the built-in becomes reachable again — the built-in is shadowed, never replaced. `builtin_unified_families()` tells you what ships here; `vendor_unified_families()` tells you what has been registered on top.

This is deliberately supported. Disagreeing with one of our families should cost you a registration call, not a fork.

## 4. What the contract requires

These are the properties the conformance corpus checks, and the reasons it checks them. A parser that violates one will look correct in a demo and fail in production.

| | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **One parser per stream** | A factory builds one parser for one choice of one request. Keep per-stream state in the parser, never in the factory or a global. |
| **Order is the output** | Emit events in the order the model produced them. Do not hoist all reasoning to the front; that is precisely the defect the ordered event stream exists to remove. |
| **Split-invariance** | The same bytes must produce the same events regardless of where the transport split them. Test every split point around your markers, not just a few. |
| **Never leak your own markup** | Bytes you consumed as structure must not reappear in visible text. |
| **Argument bytes are verbatim** | Forward argument fragments exactly as the model emitted them. Do not reformat, reorder keys, or re-serialize. |
| **Recover, do not panic** | Malformed or truncated output is normal. Emit what you can and drop what you cannot; returning an error should be reserved for genuinely unusable input. On `Err`, whatever you already appended stays committed. |
| **Flush on `finish`** | Open reasoning is promoted, not dropped and not leaked as text. |

## 5. Optional capabilities

All have defaults, so implement only what your grammar needs.

| Method | Implement it when |
|---|---|
| `initialize(&[u32])` | your prompt can end mid-channel and you want to detect that from prompt tokens |
| `preserve_special_tokens()` | your markers ARE tokenizer special tokens, so text that dropped them is unparseable |
| `tool_call_id(idx)` | your grammar names the call itself and the id should come from the model |
| `reset()` | you can hand back unconsumed text on abort. Note this returns to a FRESH-STREAM state — tool indices restart, so the returned text must be re-parsed as a NEW stream |

## 6. Check it against the corpus

The conformance corpus is the useful part of this repo. Point it at your parser to find the cases you have not thought of: malformed envelopes, markers split mid-token, marker-looking text inside a JSON string, reasoning interleaved with calls, guided payloads that fail schema rather than syntax.

```bash
cargo test --workspace --all-targets --locked
```

`builtin_unified_families()` is what the suite iterates, and a vendor registration deliberately does NOT enrol itself there — a family with no cases would otherwise report as covered while nothing measured it. Add cases for your family before trusting a green run.

## 7. Alignment with peer traits

This trait is aligned with the peer streaming-parser traits other serving engines expose: `parse_into` is the required method, `finish` returns an output buffer, the event type carries the same variants in the same order, and `initialize` takes prompt token IDs. A parser written against a peer trait ports here mostly by renaming.

Two caveats worth knowing before you plan on a literal drop-in:

- Rust is nominally typed, so an identically-shaped type in another crate is still a different type. Porting is a mechanical translation, not a recompile.
- This crate adds surface the peer traits do not have — `parse_complete` and the assembled `UnifiedEvent` view. Both are additive, so a peer-shaped caller never sees them, and a peer-shaped parser that does not provide them falls back to their defaults.
