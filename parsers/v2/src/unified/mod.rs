//! Unified parsing: ONE streaming state machine per stream that owns reasoning,
//! visible content, and tool calls, and emits ONE ordered event stream.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Dynamo serves today by chaining two independent parsers: a reasoning parser
//! strips `<think>...</think>` over the whole stream into a single assembled
//! `reasoning_text` field, and a tool parser then scans the leftover content.
//! That shape cannot represent WHERE reasoning happened. Every thought is
//! hoisted to the front and merged into one span, so
//!
//! ```text
//! <think>Look it up.</think><tool_call>…</tool_call><think>Now answer.</think>It's 18C.
//! ```
//!
//! serves as `reasoning("Look it up.Now answer.")` → call → `text("It's 18C.")`:
//! the second thought moved ahead of the call it followed and fused with the
//! first. A client rendering thoughts inline shows them in the wrong place, and
//! a client counting reasoning turns sees one where there were two.
//!
//! Ordering is not a field the split can add; it is lost at the seam between the
//! two parsers. So a unified parser owns the whole grammar and emits deltas in
//! the order the model produced them:
//!
//! ```text
//! reasoning("Look it up.") | tool_call(get_weather, …) | reasoning("Now answer.") | text("It's 18C.")
//! ```
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! [`UnifiedDelta`] is the streaming vocabulary — what one `push` produced, in
//! order. [`UnifiedEvent`] is the assembled view: adjacent same-kind deltas
//! coalesced and per-call argument fragments joined into one typed object
//! (`I8`). [`assemble`] is the single implementation of that fold, so callers
//! and conformance harnesses never reimplement it and drift.
//!
//! Note this is a genuine unified parser, not vLLM's `CombinedParser` shape:
//! vLLM 0.25.x keeps `extract_tool_calls_streaming` and
//! `extract_reasoning_streaming` as two chained APIs behind a unified interface
//! (only gemma4 is natively unified there), which reproduces the same seam.
